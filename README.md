# Hello there!

### Welcome to the DS/Algo for Interviews Repository. I've compiled a set of problems from various topics like Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Graph Theory, Sliding Window, Trees, etc. Except for Dynamic Programming problems where I've used Python, I've generally used C++ in most cases. Also, I've used classes and structs wherever I could to keep things modular. Some of the mind-boggling problems are also well-commented for the lucid understanding of the logic. Hope you make the most out of it.


Cheers =)
